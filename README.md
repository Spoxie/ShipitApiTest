# ShipitApiTest
Testing Shipit API

Hellou fellow mate!

JUST GIVING YOU A HEADS UP!
As you can see, there are two "versions" of this projects frontend. The first one is just typical testing, when I wasn't very "good" with Angular and TypeScript. The code is very messy, and the "parent to child" relations between components are a whack. Each component makes an attempt to reach backend individually. Not really good tbh!

The second one is the main program I used on my thesis work! :)
