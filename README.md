# ShipitApiTest
Testing Shipit API

Heads up!
As you can see, there are two "versions" of this projects frontend. The first one is just typical testing, when I wasn't very "good" with Angular and TypeScript. The code is very messy, and the "parent to child" relations between components are a whack.

The second one is the main program I used on my thesis work! :) Initially, both are pretty much same, but the second testapp works better.
